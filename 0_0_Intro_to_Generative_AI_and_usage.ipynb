    "2. what are AI and ML : \n",
    "    - AI is the simulation of human intelligence processed by computer systems. it enables machines to analyze and interpret complex data, learn from examples, make informed decisions or take action. AI Requires extensive domain knowledge and emphasizes on human expertise to design and execute the intelligent systems use cases : Humanoid robots, Crop Monitoring, Creating smart content\n",
    "    - ML : it involves the development and implementation of algorithms and models which enable computer systems to learn and make predictions or decisions. ML helps to train computer systems using large datasets. ML allows a machine to learn autonomously from past data use cases: customer churn, credit card fraud detection, image classification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. what is DL and GenAI: \n",
    "    - DL : it focuses on development and implementation of artificial neural networks inspired by the structure and function of human brain. it involves in training these neural networks to learn and makes predictions or decisions. use cases :  speech recognition, voice and image recognition, NLP like chatbots and voice assistants\n",
    "    - Gen AI : it is a type of AI system capable of generating text, images or other media in response to prompts. Gen AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and it then generates new data that has similar characteristics. use cases : creative content generation, virtual avatars, data augmentation and synthesis\n",
    "    - it focuses o building systems which will generate new fresh data such as audio, video, images and text"
